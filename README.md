1. Created a web server using Node.js.
2. Will Handle multiple routes.
3. Used proper HTTP status codes.
4. Will Handle Invalid routes.

In this project I created a simple web server using Node.js http module. The server runs on port 3000 and listen for request from browser. When user open any route, server check the url and send the HTML page related to it.

Routes like /home, /about and /contact shows different pages. If user type wrong route then server shows 404 page. HTML and CSS is written directly in server file using res.end().

This project help me to understand basic routing and working of Node.js server.


Run Server Using :- npm run dev
